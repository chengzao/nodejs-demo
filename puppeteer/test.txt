###### What can I do?

Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

* Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
* Crawl a SPA and generate pre-rendered content (i.e. "SSR").
* Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.
* Create an up-to-date, automated testing environment. Run your tests directly in the latest version of Chrome using the latest JavaScript and browser features.
